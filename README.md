## Introduction to the project

This project is part of Week 1 of the Makers Academy software engineering programme. It focuses on test-driven development and object-oriented programming skills to satisfy the client's requirements presented in 'challenge_instructions.md'.

The aim of this project is to write software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy in which case no planes can land or take off.

## Motivation: What are my goals for this project?

#### For this challenge, I am specifically targeting the following Makers Academy goals:

**I can make anything**

- I can TDD anything
- I can debug anything
- I can model anything
- I have a methodical approach to solving problems

**I am equipped for long term growth**

- I can learn anything by myself

#### Relating to the above high-level goals, I would like to:

- Document and explain the processes and approaches I used

> This is presented in: 'kd_approach.md'.

Concrete things
- Apply the RSpec testing framework to test-drive the program

Concepts
- Understand how to test-drive objects & methods

Processes
- Use test-driven development to test-drive a simple program to control the flow of planes at an airport using objects and methods

Behaviours/mindset
- Take a step back to understand and break down requirements into user stories and test cases

## Tech/Framework Used

RSpec will be used as the testing framework.  

>"RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an approach
to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain Driven Design,
and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation,
focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD." 

See documentation:
https://relishapp.com/rspec
http://rspec.info/

Ruby will be used as the programming language.

## Code Style

I will be checking my code conforms to the [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) style guide.

## Images/Screenshots

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/kimdiep/airport_challenge.git`

## Usage

## Running tests

Tests can be run from the root directory using:

`rspec`
